MY FIRST EVER SNAKE GAME...

Just like the basic snake, only change is the 1/10 golden apple spawn that increases average speed by 7/5, and increments points by 2

Secret Settings: Press P to Pause
Future improvements: Movement logic, responsive movement that makes the game smoother, sometimes play can collide into the snake segment attached to their head with ninja moves, Dont RELY movement speed on FPS, perhaps listen for the first VALID movement input and veto all following inputs until next position is reached.
